<h2><a name="FORGOTTEN_FACTS_AND_FANCIES" id="FORGOTTEN_FACTS_AND_FANCIES"></a>FORGOTTEN FACTS AND FANCIES<br />
OF AMERICAN HISTORY</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapa"><span class="dropcap">A</span></span>S civilization advances there develops
in the heart of man a higher
appreciation of the past, and the
deeds of preceding generations
come to be viewed with a calm
criticism which denudes those
deeds of false splendor and increases
the lustre of real accomplishment.
Man cannot see into the future and
acquire the prescience of coming events which
would make him infallible, but he can remove the
veil from the past, contemplate the mistakes and
successes of those who have lived before him, and
who struggled with the same problems which now
confront him. The results of their efforts are recorded
in history, and inspired by high ideals he can
study the past, and by feeding his lamp of wisdom
with the oil of their experiences he secures a
greater light to guide his own activities. Man
remains a slave to Fate until Knowledge makes
him free, and while all true knowledge comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>
from experience, it need not necessarily be <i>personal</i>
experience.</p>

<p>In studying the past, deeds come to be estimated
more with reference to their ultimate results and as
factors in universal progress, and less as personal
efforts; just as more and more the personal merges
into the universal in all lines of endeavor. Viewed
in this light of ultimate results an imperishable and
increased lustre envelops the name of Sir Walter
Raleigh as the pioneer and faithful promoter of
English colonization in America. The recognition
of his services by the people who reap the reward
of his labors has ever been too meagre. A portrait
here and there, the name of the capital city in
a State, a mention among other explorers on a
tablet in the National Library, the name of a battleship,
and a few pages in history, help to remind us
of his association with this nation. Perhaps a few
may recognize his personal colors&mdash;red and white&mdash;in
the binding in this book, and his Coat of Arms
in the heraldic device which ornaments the cover,
and which are mentioned "lest we forget" one we
should honor.</p>

<p>The present and ever increasing greatness of
these United States is due to the efforts of this
remarkable man, who so wondrously combined in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span>
one personality the attributes of statesman, courtier,
soldier, scientist, poet, explorer, and martyr. Isabella
of Spain offered her jewels to aid Columbus,
and the deed has been lauded and celebrated as of
international value, yet it contained no touch of
personal sacrifice. She was never deprived of her
jewels, and while her generous offer proved her
faith in the theories and ability of Columbus, it
brought to her no suffering. On the other hand,
the efforts of Sir Walter Raleigh were at his own
expense, and entailed financial disaster on him in
the end. That he sought to extend the power of
England must be admitted by those who correctly
estimate his character; yet no one will deny that
he was the most important factor in the colonization
of America by the English. Spain, France, and
England contended long for supremacy in the New
World, but France failed to gain any permanent
power, and Spanish dominance, as illustrated in
South America and Mexico, was followed by slow
progress. It was the English race, <i>led by Raleigh</i>,
which has become the leading power and modern
strength of America. Colony after colony he sent
to the new land, and desisted not, even after the
death of his half-brother and coadjutor, Sir Humphrey
Gilbert. Disaster could not daunt so brave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
a spirit, and with unsurpassed enterprise and perseverance
he continued to send expeditions year after
year to what is now the coast of North Carolina, but
which was then called Virginia, and recognized as
Raleigh's possessions. Much money was required,
and when his own fortune was exhausted he transferred
to what is known as the London Company
his rights to the land, and <i>by his advice</i> they avoided
his mistakes and made the next settlement at Jamestown
instead of Roanoak Island.</p>

<p>These facts have been temporarily obscured by
the moss of neglect, but they cannot be destroyed.
They will ever remain the foundation-stones of the
great structure known and respected among nations
as the United States of America, and were laid by
Sir Walter Raleigh at Roanoak Island, on the coast
of North Carolina, which was then called Virginia.
The intervening years have brought great results,
those early struggles have ripened into success and
greatness beyond Raleigh's most sanguine dreams.
A new race has arisen, yet bearing the characteristics
of the race from which it sprung. Our English
ancestors, our heritage of English law and custom,
of religion and home life, of language and ideals,
all tempered by the development of new characteristics,
bind us <i>through him</i> to England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Walter Raleigh was not an ordinary man.
He was one of the most remarkable of a coterie of
remarkable men whom a remarkable queen (Elizabeth)
gathered around her, and to whom she owed
much of the grandeur of her remarkable reign.
Elizabeth's greatest gift was a capacity for discerning
and using great minds, and she had the good
fortune to find many around her at that period of
time. Raleigh won her favor, and received from
her many benefits, among which was the honor of
knighthood with its emoluments, which she conferred.
In the end her favor cost him dear, because
his heart had the courage to be true to itself in love.
Elizabeth never forgave him for loving, marrying,
and being true until death to her maid of honor,
the beautiful Elizabeth Throckmorton. That vain
and jealous queen permitted no rivals, and she
wished to reign over the heart of this man, who,
handsome, brave, gallant, intelligent, and romantic,
made an ideal courtier. His life at court was brilliant
but brief. Love anchored a soul attuned to
loftier deeds, and after his marriage his career as a
courtier was eclipsed by his later exploits as a statesman,
warrior, explorer, and author. He planned
and participated in many expeditions which brought
benefit to his queen and added to his own fortune,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
yet none of his expeditions have borne such an
ever-increasing harvest of results as those he sent to
America. He began that work in 1584, and continued
to send expeditions in 1585-1586-1587, until
the invasion of England by the Spanish Armada
forced him to other activities, and even then he sent
two expeditions to the relief of the colonists, which,
because of the exigencies of war, failed to reach
America. In fact, the attitude of Spain towards
England at that time was the greatest obstacle which
militated against the success of his colonies. His
ships and his valor were necessary to suppress and
check the insolence and ambition of Spain, who designed
to conquer England and become mistress of
the world. By his valor, loyalty, and wisdom Raleigh
was largely instrumental in bringing about the failure
of those plans and in defeating the Spanish fleet,
which had been boastingly named The Invincible
Armada. Again his zeal and cool daring won for
England the great victory of Cadiz, which has
always ranked as the most remarkable achievement
in the annals of naval warfare. With only seven
ships he dashed in and destroyed a large Spanish
fleet (fifty-five ships) in its own harbor with a dexterity
and valor not surpassed even by Dewey at
Manila nor by Schley at Santiago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>

<p>Spain was always his foe because she feared him,
and it seems like the Nemesis of fate that three hundred
years later the death-blow of Spain as a world
power was dealt in Manila Bay by the nation which
Raleigh strove so hard to plant, himself all unconscious
of what the years were to bring. On that
famous morning when Dewey startled the world
and chastised Spain for her insolence and cruelty,
the ship which fired the first shot in a battle destined
to change the rating of two nations, the
ship which first replied to the fire of the Spanish
forts, as if answering the challenge of an old-time
foe,&mdash;that ship was the <i>Raleigh</i>, named in honor
of that great man by the nation he had fostered,
and in that battle Raleigh's foe was humbled,
Raleigh's fame perpetuated, and Raleigh's death
avenged.</p>

<p>After the death of Elizabeth the star of Raleigh
set. He whose most valiant work had been the
defense of England against the attacks of Spain was
falsely charged with treasonable negotiations with
Spain, and after a farce of a trial was thrown into
prison, where he remained more than twelve years.
The only mitigations of the horrors of prison life were
the presence of his devoted wife and his books. He
had always been a student, and he spent the weary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
hours of his long confinement in that companionship
which is known only to those who really love books,
and to such minds they prove a panacea for sorrow
and injustice. During that imprisonment he wrote
his famous "History of the World," marking the
eventful epoch by writing a history of the Old World
at the same time that he was opening the gates of
the future by planting English colonies in the New
World. As soon as he was released from prison his
mind returned to schemes of exploration. He made
a voyage to South America, where new disasters
befell him, and where his oldest son was killed.
Shattered by grief and misfortune he returned to
England, where his enemies had planned his certain
downfall. Again he was sent to prison, but not for
a long time, for soon his princely head paid the penalty
which true greatness has too often paid to the
power of a weak king. As a subject he was loyal
and valiant, as a husband faithful and devoted, as a
father affectionate and inspiring, as a scholar distinguished
in prose and poetry, as a soldier he won
fame and fortune, as a statesman he contributed to
the renown of his sovereign's realm, and as a man
he lived and died guided by the highest ideals.
This was the man who spent a fortune trying to
establish English colonies in North America, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
who sent repeated expeditions to the island of
Roanoak, situated where the waters of the Albemarle
and Pamlico Sounds meet, on the coast of
North Carolina, but which was then called Virginia.</p>

<p>The island wears a cluster of historic jewels which
should endear it to all patriotic Anglo-Americans.
To them it should be the most sacred, the best
loved spot in all the United States. There the first
English settlements were made which led to English
supremacy in the New World. There the first home
altar was reared and the first child of English
parents in the United States was born and baptized.
There the blood of Englishmen first dyed the sod
of North America, and there the first attempts at
English agriculture were made. There was enacted
the tragedy of American colonization, the disappearance
of Raleigh's Lost Colony, and there the
sacrament of baptism was first administered in the
United States. Roanoak Island is a beautiful place,
with fertile soil and wild luxuriance of vine-covered
forests which are enveloped in a deep solitude which
has become dignity. Restless waters ebb and flow
by its side, restless winds kiss its bare sand dunes,
a genial sun brings to maturity its wealth of tree
and vine and shrub. Protected from the storms
which ravage the ocean beyond, it sleeps in quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
beauty, content with its heritage of fame as <i>the first
home of the English race in America</i>.</p>

<p>Its isolated position, its wild beauty, its tragic
associations, its dignified repose, all seem to have
set it aside from the rush of modern progress that it
might become a shrine for the homage of a patriotic
people.</p>

<p>The wonderful fertility of the soil of this island
seemed a marvel to the early explorers, all of whom
have testified to it. Ralph Lane, governor of the
colony of 1585, in writing to Raleigh of the island
and the surrounding country, declared it to be "the
goodliest soil under the cope of heaven," and that
"being inhabited with English no realm in Christendom
were comparable to it;" every word of which
is true now, provided that the English who inhabit
it follow the suggestions of nature and adopt horticulture
as the developing means. The surrounding
country as well as Roanoak Island has a wealth of
climbing vines and clustering grapes which point
instinctively to grape culture. Amadas and Barlowe
(1584) wrote that they found the land "so full of
grapes as the very beating and surge of the sea overflowed
them, of which we found such plenty, as well
there as in all places else, both on the sand and on
the green soil, on the hills as on the plains, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
as on every little shrub as also climbing towards the
top of high cedars, that I think in all the world the
like abundance is not to be found."</p>

<span class="caption">A Scuppernong Vineyard, Roanoak Island</span>
</div>

<p>Surely no other such natural vineyard was ever
found outside the fabled Garden of the Gods!</p>

<p>Even in this generation an old resident of the
Banks, an ante-bellum pilot on these waters, has
testified that his grandfather could remember the
time "when if a vessel were stranded on any of the
beaches the crew could crawl to land on the grapevines
hanging over where now there is only a dry
sand beach." Throughout the eastern part of that
State (North Carolina) the grape riots in natural
luxuriance and is luscious and fragrant. Many
varieties remain wild, while others have been improved
by cultivation. The three finest native
American grapes, the Catawba, the Isabella, and the
Scuppernong, are all indigenous to the soil of North
Carolina. The Catawba, native to the banks of the
river Catawba, from which it takes its name, is still
found wild in North Carolina, while it has become
celebrated at the North as a table-grape, and in
Ohio as a wine-grape. In its adopted home it has
revolutionized land values because of the money
value of the product. The Isabella grape, so
generally cultivated for table use, is thought to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
hybrid between the Burgundy and the native fox-grape
of the Carolinas. The tradition runs that
the Burgundy was brought to South Carolina by the
Huguenots, and that cuttings from this hybrid were
brought to North Carolina and successfully propagated.
Mrs. Isabella Gibbs, for whom this well-known
grape was named, carried a vine from North
Carolina to Long Island, where it attracted attention
because of its hardiness.</p>

<p>To the people of the South Atlantic coast the
Scuppernong is by far the most important of the
native grapes, for while it refuses to flourish away
from its native home, yet its great possibilities as a
wine-grape are beginning to be appreciated. All
the early explorers gave it special mention. Hariot
in his famous Narrative wrote, "There are two kinds
of grapes that the soil does yield naturally, the one
is small and sour, of the ordinary bigness of ours in
England; the other far greater and of <i>himself luscious
sweet</i>. When they are planted and husbanded as
they ought, a principal commodity of wines by them
may be raised." (Hakluyt, 1586.) Lawson in his
history (1714) describes several varieties, and dwells
on the abundant supply of grapes and the great
tangles of green vines. He wrote of a native <i>white</i>
grape, which many in that day thought existed only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
in his imagination; but it was a reality and was the
now well-known Scuppernong, whose fame history
and tradition both perpetuate, and whose real worth,
greater than its legendary fame, is now being recognized
and appreciated. There are several varieties
of the Scuppernong, all luscious and yielding rich
juices, and when ripe they fill the air with a fragrance
unknown to any other grape.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<a name="mother" id="mother"></a>
<img src="images/image012.jpg" width="350" height="600" alt="Old &quot;Mother&quot; Scuppernong Vine." title="Old &quot;Mother&quot; Scuppernong Vine." />
<span class="caption">Old &quot;Mother&quot; Scuppernong Vine.</span>
</div>

<p>The first Scuppernong vine known to history was
found on the mainland of the North Carolina coast
by Amadas and Barlowe on their first voyage (1584).
Tradition relates that they transplanted this vine to
Roanoak Island. On this island there still flourishes
an old vine, which despite its gnarled body and
evident age continues to bear fruit. It is claimed
that it is the same vine Amadas and Barlowe planted.
Some insist that it was planted by Sir Walter Raleigh
himself, but as that famous knight did not realize his
wish to visit his new possessions in North America,
the honor of having planted the vine must revert to
Amadas and Barlowe. It seems to be endowed
with perennial youth, and the harvest from its
branches is an annual certainty.</p>

<p>What the early explorers testified as to the abundant
supply of grapes on the Carolina coast, and the
propitious conditions existing for the propagation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
the vine, is equally true to-day. The manifest destiny
of North Carolina as the rival of Southern France
in the production of wines seems to be inevitable.
The marvel is how it has been so long delayed after
Hariot's special mention of such possibilities. Hariot
was a close observer with a practical mind, and the
presence of an indigenous supply of material to sustain
an important industry suggested to him that the
people coming to this grape-laden land might establish
such an industry to their advantage. The delay
of the development of grape-culture in its native
home can only be explained on the theory that when
nature boldly invites, man becomes shy. This indifference
to grape-culture is peculiar to America, for
in Europe all the aristocracy who are land-owners,
where the climate makes it possible, are cultivators
of the grape, take great pride in their wines, boast
of their rare and fine vintages, and hold the making
of wine as one of the fine arts.</p>

<p>The original Scuppernong has white skin, white
pulp, white juice, and makes a white wine. Other
varieties have dark purple skins and yield a reddish
juice which makes a red wine. The dark varieties
are said to be <i>seedlings</i> from the original white variety,
and tradition explains the metamorphosis in
this way.</p>

<span class="i0">Pushing upward to the sunlight."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Tradition says that this "tiny shoot with leaflets"
was a young seedling of the Scuppernong which had
sprouted in the edge of the water, and it was not
seen by O-kis-ko until all the water had disappeared.
Then he saw it and immediately associated its appearance
with the magic arrow, and so left it "reaching
upward to the sunlight." After many days he
returned to the spot-drawn by an irresistible longing,
and covered the fatal arrow, which had brought
him so much woe, with earth and leaves to hide
it from his sight. The earth and leaves furnished
the necessary nourishment to the tiny vine, which
reached out with strength and vigor, and finding
friendly bushes upon which to climb, it soon made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
sheltering bower above the spot where had bubbled
the magic spring. This tiny green bower became the
favorite retreat of O-kis-ko, where he would linger to
cherish thoughts of his lost love, Virginia Dare, and
marvel on the wonders of her death. Then it came
to pass that when fruit came upon this vine, lo! it
was purple in hue instead of white like the other
grapes, and yielded a <i>red</i> juice. Full of superstition,
and still credulous of marvels, O-kis-ko imagined
the change to be due to the magic arrow buried
at its root. He gathered the grapes and pressed the
juice from them, and lo! it was <i>red</i>&mdash;it was the semblance
of blood, <i>Virginia Dare's blood</i>, absorbed
from the water (in which it had melted from the
arrow) by the vine, and yet potent for good. Surely
it held some unseen power, for it combined in some
mystic way through the mysterious earth at his feet
all the power of the magic spring, the power of the
silver arrow, and the power of human blood consecrated
through human love. He reverently drank
the juice of this new vine, believing that it would in
some way link him with the spirit of her he had
loved and lost. Year after year he drank this juice
and fed his soul on thoughts of love, making unconsciously
a sacrament, and finding happiness in the
thought that the blood of the maiden would feed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
spirit and lead him to her at last. To become good
like her and to go to her became his highest hope.
Aspiration had been born in his soul, and quickened
by love it could not die, but led him blindly to strive
to reach her, and such striving is never in vain.</p>

<p>Another fact that should be enshrined in the
hearts and perpetuated in the memorials of the
nation, is that on Roanoak Island the first Christian
baptism in the United States was administered. By
order of Sir Walter Raleigh, Manteo, the friendly
Indian chief, was baptized soon after the arrival of
the colony under Governor White, and the following
Sunday Virginia Dare, the granddaughter of Governor
White, was baptized, both events being officially
reported to Raleigh. In this day of religious freedom
any enforced adoption of religious forms shocks
our pious instincts. Yet baptism has always been
considered <i>necessary</i> to salvation, and in the past
the zeal of Christians for the salvation of their fellow-men
often assumed the form of mild force. We read
where the Spaniards, always religious fanatics, administered
the Holy Sacrament to thousands in
Central America and Mexico <i>at the point of the
sword</i>; their zeal misleading them to force upon
those less enlightened than themselves the hope of
that heaven which they believed to be accessible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
only through certain Christian rites. So to order
the baptism of an Indian chief seems a simple,
kindly thing, and most probably Manteo desired it
done. The only other Indian who received baptism
in those early settlements was Pocahontas, in 1614.
She was a captive at the time and held as a hostage
to induce Powhatan to comply with certain demands
of the colonists at Jamestown.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Virginia Dare was baptized
twenty-seven years earlier than Pocahontas, yet it is
the Indian Princess who is figured in the painting
on the walls of the dome of the Capitol at Washington
as receiving the first baptism in the colonies.
Buried in the annals of that time lies the fact that
twenty-seven years before any colonist even came
to Jamestown, Virginia Dare was born and baptized,
as the sequence of Christian birth and as the
child of Christian parents. Virginia Dare was not a
myth. She was a living, breathing reality, a human
creature of good English descent, the granddaughter
of the governor of the colonies, the daughter of
the assistant governor, and a sharer in the mysterious
fate of Raleigh's Lost Colony. The historical
facts of her life and the legend of her fate and
death are contained in the pages of "The White
Doe."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span></p>

<p>Her baptism would not have been mentioned in
the records if it had not been official and proper.
In a new land, surrounded by dangers and difficulties,
with strange environment to divert the mind
to other channels, it would have been easy and
natural for her baptism to have been delayed if not
altogether neglected amid the stress of events. Her
prompt baptism and the official report of the event
to Sir Walter Raleigh is convincing testimony to
the presence of a chaplain at Roanoak.</p>


<h3>THE FIRST BAPTISM IN THE WILDS OF
AMERICA!</h3>

<p>How naturally the scene rises before us. The
young mother, her heart thrilling with the mysteries
of love and life, and elated with the joy of motherhood,
alert to the dangers of the new land, and suspicious
of the strange people among whom her
blue-eyed treasure must live, yet yielding cheerfully
to the busy smiling English women who had crossed
the ocean with her, and now with womanly intuition
ministered to her needs. We can picture them
making tidy the confused household, and stilling the
cries of the infant as they prepare her to receive
the sign of the cross. We can almost picture them
deliberating over a choice from among their limited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
supply of vessels of one worthy to become the receptacle
of the water to be used. It was on the
Sabbath-Day, and the dedication to God of the
wee creature who had so newly come among them
was a fitting observance of the day. The solemn
words of the ritual of the English Church, never
before spoken in that primeval forest, must have
awakened mysterious vibrations which linger yet
and give to Roanoak Island that atmosphere of
perpetual repose which envelops it. There must
have come to those who witnessed the scene that
holy Sabbath-Day, just as it comes now to those
who view it from afar, a deep realization that the
God of the English and the Great Spirit of the Indian
are one and the same, then, now, and evermore.
The One God to whom in baptism Virginia
Dare was brought and in whose name Manteo the
savage was signed with the cross and given the
promise of salvation, and who remains the God of
the millions of English-speaking people who now
worship in the land which was then and there dedicated
to the service of Christ.</p>

<p>The mist of oblivion fades before the light of
Truth, and Virginia Dare will be a shining jewel in
the Chaplet of Memories which some day Christian
America will place upon the tomb of the Past.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>A familiar knowledge of the history of one's
own country increases patriotism and stimulates
valor. For this reason the study of written records
called history should be supplemented by research
into myths, folk-lore, and legends. While the
value of history lies ever in its truth, it must yet
bear the ideals of the people who participated in
the events narrated. Tradition was the mother
of all history, and was necessarily robed in the
superstitions of the era of which the tradition tells.
History writers, jealously guarding the truth, have
striven to banish all traditions which seemed colored
by fancy or even freighted with a moral lesson.
These exiled traditions, bearing the seed-germs of
truth, cannot die, but, like wandering spirits, float
down the centuries enveloped in the mists of superstition,
until finally, embodied in romance or song,
they assume a permanent form called legend and
become the heritage of a people. Legends are
the satellites of history because they have their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
origin in the same events, and the history of all
countries is interspersed with them.</p>

<p>The legend of The White Doe is probably the
oldest and possibly the least known of all the
legends which relate to the history of the United
States. It is a genuine American legend, and the
facts from which it had its origin form the first
chapter in the history of English colonization in
North America. Those facts are found in the
repeated attempts of Sir Walter Raleigh to establish
an English colony in the New World. The
Spaniards were in Florida, the French were in
Nova Scotia, but England had gained no possessions
in North America when Raleigh began his
efforts. This fact assumes more importance when
we remember that civilization has made the greatest
progress in those parts of America where the
English became dominant. In South America,
dominated by the Spaniards, civilization has made
no strides, while in the United States a new nation
has arisen whose ultimate destiny none may limit
or foretell. As the gates of a new century open
and disclose almost unlimited fields for human
progress, this new nation, with an enthusiasm and
courage born of success, has taken her place to
lead in the eternal forward search for better opportunities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and higher life for the human race.
All this grand destiny, all this ripening opportunity,
like a harvest from a few seeds, is traced back,
event after event, to the early struggles of those
who braved the dangers of sea and forest in the
attempts to colonize America. Those pioneer
efforts, so generously promoted by Sir Walter
Raleigh, though only partially successful, were the
stepping-stones which later led to the better-known
settlement of Jamestown, in Virginia. A brief
<i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of those stepping-stones will make them
familiar to all.</p>

<p>In 1584 Queen Elizabeth made a grant to
Raleigh for all the land from Nova Scotia to
Florida, which was called Virginia, in honor of the
Virgin Queen, as Elizabeth was called.</p>

<p>The first expedition sent out under this grant
was in the same year, 1584, and was entirely at
the expense of Sir Walter Raleigh, as were all of
the expeditions up to 1590. It was solely for the
purpose of exploration, and was under the command
of Amadas and Barlowe, who, after coasting
along the Atlantic shores, entered Pamlico
Sound and landed on the island of Roanoak,
on the coast of the present State of North Carolina.
They made the acquaintance of the tribes there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
resident, explored the country on the coast, and
returned to England to bear enthusiastic testimony
to the delightsomeness of the country. They took
with them back to England two native Indian
chiefs, Manteo and Wanchese, who returned to
America on a subsequent voyage, as the official
records tell.</p>

<p>The following year, 1585, a colony of one
hundred and seven men landed on this same island
of Roanoak. They came organized to occupy
and possess the land granted to Raleigh, and to
secure such benefits therefrom as in those days
were deemed valuable. They remained one year,
exploring the country and trying to establish relations
with the Indians. They built houses, planted
crops, and looked forward to the arrival of more
men and food, which had been promised from
England. But no ships came, provisions grew
scarce, and before the crops they had planted were
mature enough to harvest, Sir Francis Drake, the
great sea-rover of that day, appeared off the
island with a fleet of vessels.</p>

<p>Knowing the dangers of that coast, he did not
attempt to come to the island, but sent in to learn
of the welfare of the colony, and offered to supply
their immediate needs. They asked, among other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
things, that their sick and weak men be taken back
to England, that food for those who remained be
given them, and for a vessel in which they might
return home if they so desired, all of which Drake
granted. But a dreadful storm arose, which lasted
three days and drove the promised vessel out to
sea, with a goodly number of the colonists and
the promised food on board. Seeing thus a part
of their number and their food gone, the remaining
colonists became homesick and panic-stricken
and begged Drake to take them <i>all</i> to England,
which he did. Thus ended the first attempt at
English colonization in North America.</p>

<p>Fifteen days after their departure Sir Richard
Grenville arrived with three vessels, bringing the
promised supplies, but found the men gone.
Wishing to hold the country for England until
another colony could arrive, he left fifteen men
on the island with provisions for two years, and he
returned to England. Those fifteen men are supposed
to have been murdered and captured by
the Indians, as the next colony found only some
bones, a ruined fort, and empty houses in which
deer were feeding.</p>

<p>The leaving of those fifteen men is considered
the second attempt at colonization, and is recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
as a failure. But all success is built only
by persistent repetition of effort, and so, in 1587,
another colony came from England to this same
island of Roanoak. Among those colonists were
seventeen women and nine children, thus proving
the intention of making permanent homes, and
the hope of establishing family ties which should
for all time unite England and North America.
A few days after the arrival of this colony at
Roanoak, Virginia Dare was born,&mdash;she being the
first child born of English parents on the soil of
North America,&mdash;and because she was the first
child born in Virginia she was called Virginia.
Her mother, Eleanor Dare, was the daughter of
John White, the governor of the colony, and the
wife of one of the assistant governors.</p>

<p>The Sunday following her birth she was baptized,
this being another fact of official record.</p>

<p>By Sir Walter Raleigh's command the rite of
baptism had been administered, a few days earlier,
to Manteo, an Indian chief, who had visited
England with a returning expedition, as previously
mentioned. This baptism of the adult Indian and
of the white infant were the first Christian sacraments
administered in North America, and are
worthy of commemoration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>The colonists soon found that to make possible
and permanent their home in a new land many
things were needed more than they had provided.
So at their urgent request their leader, Governor
White, grandfather of Virginia Dare, consented
to return to England to secure the needed supplies,
with which he was to return to them the
following year. When White reached England he
found war going on with Spain, and England
threatened with an invasion by the famous Spanish
Armada. His queen needed and demanded his
services, and not until 1590&mdash;three years later&mdash;did
he succeed in returning to America. When at last
he came the colonists had disappeared, and the
only clue to their fate was the word "Croatoan,"
which he found carved on a tree; it having been
agreed between them that if they changed their
place of abode in his absence they would carve
on a tree the name of the place to which they
had gone.</p>

<p>The arrival of those colonists, the birth and
baptism of Virginia Dare, the return of White to
England, the disappearance of the colony, and the
finding of the word Croatoan, these facts form
the record of that colony, the disappearance of
which is a mystery which history has not solved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>But tradition illumines many periods of the
past which history leaves in darkness, and tradition
tells how this colony found among friendly
Indians a refuge from the dangers of Roanoak
Island, and how this infant grew into fair maidenhood,
and was changed by the sorcery of a rejected
lover into <i>a white doe</i>, which roamed the
lonely island and bore a charmed life, and how
finally true love triumphed over magic and restored
her to human form,&mdash;only to result in the death
of the maiden from a silver arrow shot by a cruel
chieftain.</p>

<p>This tradition of a white doe and a silver
arrow has survived through three centuries, and
not only lingers where the events occurred, but
some portions of it are found wherever in our
land forests abound and deer abide. From Maine
to Florida lumbermen are everywhere familiar
with an old superstition that to see a white doe
is an evil omen. In some localities lumbermen
will quit work if a white deer is seen. That
such a creature as a white deer really exists is
demonstrated by their capture and exhibition in
menageries, and to-day the rude hunters of the
Alleghany Mountains believe that only a silver
arrow will kill a white deer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>The disappearance of this colony has been truly
called "the tragedy of American colonization,"
and around it has hung a pathetic interest which
ever leads to renewed investigation, in the hope
of solving the mystery. From recent search into
the subject by students of history a chain of
evidence has been woven from which it has come
to be believed that the lost colony, hopeless of
succor from England, and deprived of all other
human associations, became a part of a tribe of
friendly Croatoan Indians, shared their wanderings,
and intermarried with them, and that their
descendants are to be found to-day among the
Croatoan Indians of Robeson County, North
Carolina.</p>

<p>(Those who desire to investigate this supposed
solution of the mystery can easily secure the facts
and the conclusions formed by those who have
made a careful study of the subject.)</p>

<p>Of course, it can never be known <i>certainly</i>
whether Virginia Dare was or was not of that
number, but the full tradition of her life among
the Indians is embodied in the legend of The
White Doe.</p>

<p>Much has been written about the Indian princess
Pocahontas, and much sentiment has clustered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
around her association with the Jamestown colony,
while few have given thought to the young English
girl whose birth, baptism, and mysterious disappearance
link her forever with the earlier tragedies
of the same era of history. It seems a strange
coincidence that the Indian maiden Pocahontas,
friend and companion of the <i>White</i> Man, having
adopted <i>his</i> people as her own, should sleep in
death on English soil, while the English maiden,
Virginia Dare, friend and companion of the <i>Red</i>
Man, having adopted his people as <i>her</i> own, should
sleep in death on American soil,&mdash;the two maidens
thus exchanging nationality, and linking in life
and in death the two countries whose destinies
seem most naturally to intermingle.</p>

<p>The scattered fragments of this legend have
been carefully collected and woven into symmetry
for preservation. Notes from authentic sources
have been appended for the benefit of searchers
into the historical basis of the poem, which is
offered to the public with the hope that it may
increase interest in the early history of our home
land and strengthen the tie which binds England
and the United States.</p>

THE SILVER ARROW</h2>

we first landed very sandy and low towards the water side,
but so full of grapes as the very beating and surge of the
sea overflowed them, of which we found such plenty, as
well there as in all places else, both on the sand and on
the green soil, on the hills as in the plains, as well on
every little shrub, as also climbing towards the tops of
high cedars, that I think in all the world the like abundance

his company, walked to the north end of the island,
where Master Ralph Lane had his fort, with sundry
necessary and decent dwelling houses, made by his men
about it, the year before, where we hoped to find some
signs, or certain knowledge of our fifteen men. When
we came thither we found the fort razed down, but all
the houses standing unhurt, saving that the neather rooms
of them, and also of the fort, were overgrown with melons
of divers sorts, and deer within them, feeding on those
melons; so we returned to our company, without hope
of ever seeing any of the fifteen alive."&mdash;<i>Hakluyt.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> <a name="e" id="e"></a><i>e</i>.&mdash;"At our first landing they seemed as though
they would fight with us, but perceiving us begin to march
with our shot towards them, they turned their backs and
fled. Then Manteo, their countryman, called to them in
their own language, whom, as soon as they heard, they
returned, and threw away their bows and arrows, and
some of them came unto us embracing and entertaining
us friendly, desiring us not to gather or spoil any of their
corn, for that they had but little. We answered them
that neither their corn nor any other thing of theirs
should be diminished by any of us, and that our coming
was only to renew the old love, that was between us and
them at the first, and to live with them as brethren and
friends; which answer seemed to please them well, wherefore
they requested us to walk up to their town, who there
feasted us after their manner, and desired us earnestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
<i>that there might be some token or badge given them of
us</i>, whereby we might know them to be our friends,"
etc.</p>

<p>"And also we understood by them of Croatoan, how
that the fifteen Englishmen left at Roanoak the year
before, by Sir Richard Grenville, were suddenly set upon
by thirty of the men of Secota, Aquoscogoc, and Dasamonguepeuc,
in manner following. They conveyed themselves
secretly behind the trees, near the houses where
our men carelessly lived, and having perceived that of
those fifteen they could see but eleven only, two of those
savages appeared to the eleven Englishmen, calling to
them by friendly signs that but two of their chief men
should come unarmed to speak with those two savages,
who seemed also to be unarmed. Wherefore two of the
chiefest of our Englishmen went gladly to them; but
whilst one of those savages traitorously embraced one
of our men, the other with his sword of wood, which
he had secretly hidden under his mantle, struck him on
the head and slew him, and presently the other eight and
twenty savages shewed themselves; the other Englishman
perceiving this, fled to his company, whom the savages
pursued with their bows and arrows so fast that the Englishmen
were forced to take the house, wherein all their
victuals and weapons were; but the savages forthwith
set the same on fire, by means whereof our men were
forced to take up such weapons as came first to hand,
and without order to run forth among the savages, with
whom they skirmished above an hour. In this skirmish
another of our men was shot into the mouth with an arrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
where he died; and also one of the savages was shot into
the side by one of our men, with a wild fire arrow, whereof
he died presently. The place where they fought was of
great advantage to the savages, by means of the thick
trees, behind which the savages through their nimbleness
defended themselves, and so offended our men with their
arrows, that our men, being some of them hurt, retired
fighting to the water side where their boat lay, with which
they fled towards Hatorask. By that time they had rowed
but a quarter of a mile, they espied their four fellows
coming from a creek thereby, where they had been to
fetch oysters; these four they received into their boat,
leaving Roanoak, and landed on a little island on the
right hand of our entrance into the harbor of Hatorask,
where they remained awhile, but afterwards departed,
whither as yet we know not."&mdash;<i>Hakluyt.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> <a name="f" id="f"></a><i>f</i>.&mdash;"The thirteenth of August, our savage,
Manteo, by the commandment of Sir Walter Raleigh,
was christened in Roanoak, and called Lord thereof, and
of Dasamonguepeuc, in reward of his faithful services."&mdash;<i>Hakluyt.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> <a name="g" id="g"></a><i>g</i>.&mdash;"The eighteenth, Eleanor, daughter to the
Governor, and wife to Ananias Dare, one of the assistants,
was delivered of a daughter, in Roanoak, and the same
was christened there the Sunday following, and because
this child was the first Christian born in Virginia, she was
named Virginia."&mdash;<i>Hakluyt.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> <a name="h" id="h"></a><i>h</i>.&mdash;"The twenty-second of August, the whole
company, both of the assistants and planters, came to
the Governor, and with one voice requested him to return
himself into England, for the better and sooner obtaining
of supplies and other necessaries for them; but he refused
it, and alleged many sufficient causes why he would
not.... The next day, not only the assistants,
but divers others, as well women as men, began to
renew their requests to the Governor again, to take upon
him to return into England for the supplies and dispatch
of all such things as there were to be done....
The Governor being at the last, through their extreme
entreating, constrained to return into England, having
then but half a day's respite to prepare himself for the
same, departed from Roanoak the seven and twentieth
of August in the morning, and the same day about midnight
came aboard the Fly-boat who already had weighed
anchor, and rode without the bar, the admiral riding by
them, who but the same morning was newly come thither
again. The same day both the ships weighed anchor and
set sail for England."&mdash;<i>Hakluyt.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> <a name="k" id="k"></a><i>k</i>.&mdash;"Our boats and all things filled again, we
put off from Hatorask, being the number of nineteen
persons in both boats; but before we could get to the
place where our planters were left, it was so exceeding
dark, that we overshot the place a quarter of a mile,
where we espied towards the North end of the island the
light of a great fire through the woods to the which we
presently rowed: when we came right over against it we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
let fall our grapnel near the shore, and sounded with a
trumpet a call, and afterwards many familiar English
tunes of songs, and called to them friendly; but we had
no answer, we therefore landed at daybreak, and coming
to the fire we found the grass and sundry rotten trees
burning about the place. From hence we went through
the woods to that part of the island directly over against
Dasamonguepeuc, and from thence we returned by the
water side round about the north point of the island,
until we came to the place where I left our colony in the
year 1586. In all this way we saw in the sand the print
of the savages' feet of two or three sorts trodden in the
night; and as we entered up the sandy bank, upon a
tree, in the very brow thereof, were curiously carved these
fair Roman letters C. R. O., which letters presently we
knew to signify the place where I should find the planters
seated, according to a secret token agreed upon between
them and me at my last departure from them; which
was, that in any way they should not fail to write or
carve on the trees or posts of the doors the name of the
place where they should be seated; for at my coming
away they were prepared to remove from Roanoak fifty
miles into the main. Therefore at my departure from
them in An. 1587, I willed them that if they should
happen to be distressed in any of those places, that then
they should carve over the letters or name, a cross &#8224; in
this form; but we found no such sign of distress....
And having well considered of this, we passed towards
the place where they were left in sundry houses, but we
found the houses taken down, and the place very strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
enclosed with a high palisade of great trees, with curtains
and flankers, very fort-like, and one of the chief trees or
posts at the right side of the entrance had the bark taken
off, and five feet from the ground in fair capital letters
was graven CROATOAN without any cross or sign of
distress.... I greatly joyed that I had safely found
a certain token of their safe being at Croatoan, which is
the place where Manteo was born, and the savages of
the island our friends."&mdash;<i>From Governor White's account

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> <a name="o" id="o"></a><i>o</i>.&mdash;"The manner of making their boats in Virginia
is very wonderful. For whereas they want instruments
of iron or others like unto ours, yet they know how to make
them as handsomely, to sail with where they list in their
rivers, and to fish withal, as ours. First they choose some
long and thick tree, according to the bigness of the boat
which they would frame, and make a fire on the ground
about the roots thereof, kindling the same by little and
little with dry moss of trees, and chips of wood that the
flame should not mount up too high, and burn too much
of the length of the tree. When it is almost burnt through,
and ready to fall they make a new fire which they suffer
to burn until the tree falls of its own accord. Then
burning off the top and boughs of the tree in such wise
that the body of the same may retain his just length,
they raise it upon poles laid over cross wise upon forked
posts at such a reasonable height as they may handsomely
work upon it. Then take they off the bark with certain
shells; they reserve the innermost part of the bark for
the nethermost part of the boat. On the other side they
make a fire according to the length of the body of the
tree saving at both the ends. That which they think is
sufficiently burned, they quench and scrape away with
shells, and making a new fire they burn it again and so
they continue, sometimes burning and sometimes scraping
until the boat have sufficient bottoms."&mdash;<i>Harriot's Report.</i></p>
